## üìù Description

Before I Fly is an eCommerce store built for everyone who loves traveling. As a travel lover myself, the need to go to 10 different stores and places to buy everything I need prior to my trip has always given me anxiety. Before I Fly was built to solve this problem. It is the ultimate one-stop shop for all your travel needs. From luggages to travel-size toiletries, neck pillows, portable chargers and much more! 

This full stack application was built with the MERN stack, along with Stripe API to process payments and Ant Design to provide a rich, interactive user experience.
Sign up and log in authentication was developed using JSON web tokens and bcrypt to hash passwords with salt.
